# 1.1 Why Hardcaml

# Ways to Design Hardware

Most commonly, hardware is designed using (System)Verilog or VHDL. Both are called
hardware description languages (HDLs) and provide features to both write and test a
hardware design. Each language exposes a subset which is called 'synthesizable,' i.e.,
able to be turned into hardware. The full language can only be used for testing.

A more recent alternative is High Level Synthesis (HLS). Here, hardware designs are
expressed in C or C++ (there may be other hosting languages available, but these are by
far the most common), and a sophisticated compiler generates an equivalent hardware design.
Notably, the exact cycle-by-cycle timing of the circuit is not specified by the designer
and is left up to the compiler. The designer can add various pragmas to guide the compiler's
choices in order to come up with a suitable hardware design that meets performance, area,
or frequency requirements.

Finally, we come to Hardware Construction Languages (HCLs) - the class to which Hardcaml
belongs. Chisel, Clash, MyHDL, PyMtl, and SpinalHDL are other examples of HCLs. Here,
hardware designs are described at a structural level within a standard software
programming language. Various tooling is provided to test your designs or convert them to
an HDL.

# Why use Hardcaml?

Hardcaml is an OCaml library. Hardcaml designs are programs written in OCaml. When a
Hardcaml program executes, it builds a data structure representing the hardware design the
user describes. From there, Hardcaml can convert it to a standard HDL, build a simulation
model for testing, among various other capabilities we will discuss in this documentation.

In terms of expressing our hardware designs, Hardcaml (and other HCLs) are able to
describe the same circuits as normal HDLs like Verilog. Similarly, if you can express it in
Hardcaml, then you can also do so in Verilog. Hardware architecture and design knowledge is
transferable between these worlds.

When we describe hardware using Hardcaml, we are performing a task called meta-programming.
This means we are writing a program to generate something - in this case, a special
representation of hardware that Hardcaml understands.

There are a number of advantages to this approach - here are a few:

- Reuse standard OCaml tooling (i.e., editor integration, continuous integration).
- Easily create highly parameterized designs. This means we can often write a design once
  but instantiate it multiple different ways to suit different requirements.
- Leverage the powerful OCaml type system to enforce invariants on our types.
- Use standard software libraries across our hardware designs and testing frameworks.
  Quickcheck for testing is a hugely useful example.

There are some downsides, of course:

- Generated HDL code (for use with vendor tooling like Vivado or Quartus) is computer
  generated and nothing like what a human would write.
- Hardcaml makes up names in generated code that look like `_8277`. This isn't very
  helpful when reading the logs from vendor tools. We have some tricks we can play here to
  make things a bit easier.

Of course the above is all a matter of opinion and you should make up your own!

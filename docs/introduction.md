Hardcaml is a library for designing and simulating *Register Transfer Level*
(RTL) hardware designs. Hardcaml designs can be converted to Verilog or VHDL for
use with vendor synthesis and place and route tools.

# Library Overview

## `Comb.S`, `Bits` and `Signal`s

The module type
[`Comb.S`](https://ocaml.org/p/hardcaml/latest/doc/Hardcaml/Comb/module-type-S/index.html)
defines the [combinational logic](combinational_logic.md) primitives
(i.e. logical operations, arithmetic, multiplexers etc.) for Hardcaml.
It is implemented by both the `Bits` and `Signal` modules. All
operations work over vectors with a given bit width. Each operation
has rules about allowable argument widths and will raise at run-time
if violated.

[`Bits`](https://ocaml.org/p/hardcaml/latest/doc/Hardcaml/Bits/index.html)
implements a shallow embedding of the `Comb.S` API. This means
it is used to compute values directly.

It seems we do not set the [am_testing] variable when running this code.

```ocaml
Hardcaml.Caller_id.set_mode Disabled
```
-->

```ocaml
# open Hardcaml.Bits
# let adder a b = a +: b;;
val adder : t -> t -> t = <fun>
# adder (of_string "01") (of_string "10")
- : t = 11
```

[`Signal`](https://ocaml.org/p/hardcaml/latest/doc/Hardcaml/Signal/index.html)
implements a deep embedding. This means it records the structure of a
computation as a graph.

```ocaml
# open Hardcaml.Signal
# open Hardcaml.Signal.Unoptimized
# let adder a b = a +: b;;
val adder : Type.t -> Type.t -> Type.t = <fun>
# adder (of_string "01") (of_string "10")
- : Type.t = (add (width 2) (arguments (0b01 0b10)))
```

Signals also provide functions related to [sequential logic](sequential_logic.md) (registers,
memories, and state machines).

In summary

- `Signal.t`s are used to construct hardware designs
- `Bits.t`s can be used to *model* combinational hardware circuits conveniently
- As we shall see, `Bits.t`s are also used for input and output ports of
  hardware simulations.

## `Circuit`s

A [circuit](circuits.md) takes the output signals of a Hardcaml
design and performs various sanity checks to ensure that it can be
converted to hardware. In particular, we must now provide input and
output port names for our designs.

```ocaml
# let c = output "c" (adder (input "a" 8) (input "b" 8))
val c : Type.t = (wire (names (c)) (width 8) (data_in add))
# let circuit = Hardcaml.Circuit.create_exn ~name:"my_adder" [ c ]
val circuit : Hardcaml.Circuit.t = <abstr>
```

## `Rtl` generation

A circuit can be [converted to RTL](rtl_generation.md) with Verilog or VHDL.

```ocaml
# Hardcaml.Rtl.print Verilog circuit
module my_adder (
    b,
    a,
    c
);

    input [7:0] b;
    input [7:0] a;
    output [7:0] c;

    wire [7:0] _4;
    assign _4 = a + b;
    assign c = _4;

endmodule
- : unit = ()
```

## Simulation with `Cyclesim`

Circuits can be [simulated with the `Cyclesim` module](simulation.md).

```ocaml
let sim = Hardcaml.Cyclesim.create circuit;;
let a = Hardcaml.Cyclesim.in_port sim "a";;
let b = Hardcaml.Cyclesim.in_port sim "b";;
let c = Hardcaml.Cyclesim.out_port sim "c";;
a := Hardcaml.Bits.of_unsigned_int ~width:8 10;;
b := Hardcaml.Bits.of_unsigned_int ~width:8 20;;
Hardcaml.Cyclesim.cycle sim;;
```

```ocaml
# Stdio.printf "c = %i\n" (Hardcaml.Bits.to_unsigned_int !c);;
c = 30
- : unit = ()
```

## Interfaces with `ppx_hardcaml`

An interface is a grouping of signals with associated names and bit widths.

```ocaml skip
# type 'a t =
  { a : 'a[@bits 8]
  ; b : 'a[@bits 7]
  }
  [@@deriving hardcaml];;
```

A large set of functions are generated, which makes working with
interfaces useful for constructing module ports or interacting with a
hardware design in simulation.

## Waveforms

`Hardcaml_waveterm` will output [waveforms](waveforms.md) of a simulation run as ASCII text.
Alongside an interactive viewer application, waveforms can also be printed as
part of expect tests.

# Examples

* [Simple counter](counter_example.md)
* [Serial multiplier](serial_multiplier_example.md)

See the [serial multiplier](serial_multiplier_example.md) in
particular for an example of using many of these features.

# Getting working hardware

Designing some hardware in Hardcaml is only part of the complete process of
getting a fully working design. Let's consider the process of creating a simple
Xilinx FPGA design.

1. Design and simulate the circuit with Hardcaml.
2. Output a Verilog (or VHDL) file.
3. Create a project in Vivado, the Xilinx FPGA synthesis, place and route tool.
4. Add board-level constraints (pins, timing etc.).
5. Synthesize, place and route the design in Vivado.
6. Run static timing analysis.  If this fails, you must correct the Hardcaml design.
7. Generate a bitstream which programs the FPGA.

For steps 1 and 2, we often use a project structure with a `bin`, `src`
and `test` directory.

* `src` a library containing the hardware design.
* `test` a test library with testbenches, expect tests etc.
* `bin` an application to generate RTL code for the Vivado toolchain.

# 5. Using Interfaces

`Interfaces` are at the core of a Hardcaml design pattern used to help build larger
designs.

We will learn how to define `Interfaces` and then how to structure Hardcaml code so we can
write hierarchical designs.

`Interfaces` will also remove a lot of boilerplate code when working with module
instantiations and simulators.

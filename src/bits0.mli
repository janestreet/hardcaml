(** The underlying representations of [Constant.t] and [Bits.t].  Not exposed by the
    Hardcaml interface.

    They are represented by 2 fields - a bit [width] and [data] represented as a
    [Bytes.t].

    Abstractly, [data] is thought of as an array of 64 bit integers. Even a single bit
    vector requires 64 bits to store it. Any unused upper bits must be set to [0] - this
    is a requirement of functions over [Bits].

    It is represented with [Bytes.t] because that is a more efficient memory layout than
    an ocaml array of [Int64]s.

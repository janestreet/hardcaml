  (** {4 Base RTL FIFO} *)

  (** [create ~clock ~clear ~wr ~d ~rd capacity] builds a FIFO with [capacity] elements
      which is written with [d] when [wr] is high and read when [rd] is high.

      Optional overflow and underflow checking may be used. Data will not be
      written(/read) when the fifo is [full](/[empty]) regardles or the [wr]/([rd])
      signals.

      [nearly_emtpy] and [nearly_full] may be programmed to go high when the fifo is
      nearing an underflow or overflow state.

      The [showahead] mode changes the read behaviour of the FIFO. When showahead is
      [false] read data is available 1 cycle after [rd] is high. With showahead [true] the
      data is available when the fifo is not [empty] (you can also think of this as data
      being available on the same cycle that [rd] is asserted). To support [showahead]
      behaviour the timing of the [full]/[empty] flag changes (although they still
      correctly indicate when it is safe to read or write to the FIFO). [showahead] mode
      has some extra cost in terms of extra logic. The implementation ensures the output
      is registered and timing performance is good - nearly as fast as the underlying RAM
      allows.

      Note; [showahead] is sometimes referred to as "first word fall through". It uses the
      write-before-read ram mode which is problematic in synthesis so we include special
      logic that performs collision detection.

      The [used] output indicates the number of elements currently in the FIFO.

      [read_latency] can be assigned to insert pipelining on the output of the FIFO to
      improve timing. *)

      data is registered. Has 3 cycles of latency, but is slightly faster than [create
      ~showahead:true] - it seems to only be limited by the underlying RAM frequency. *)

      convenient for interface with AXI streams.

      much larger FIFOs. *)

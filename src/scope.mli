(** {v
 Control of name generation in a hierarchy of modules. The position of a module within
    a hierarchy is determined by a path which leads back to the (single) top most parent
    module. Signal names may be pre-pended with some representation of that path.

    - [No_path]    - Nothing is added to the name.
    - [Local_path] - Only the name of the enclosing module is added to the name.
    - [Full_path]  - The full path is included in the name
    - [Auto]       - The full path is tracked in the scope, but names have no path.

    Generally hierarchical names are taken from the circuit name, though it is possible to
    specify a different instantiation name. These names are mangled so they are unique
    within each scope.

    [Auto] mode works in conjunction with the [Hierarchy] module to automatically rewrite
    names with full paths without having to work with explicit path names.

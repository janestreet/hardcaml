(** Interfaces specify the widths and names of a group of signals, and some functions for
    manipulating the signals as a group.

    They are generally used with [ppx_hardcaml] as follows

    {[
      type t = { ... } [@@deriving hardcaml]
    ]}

    The [sexp_of] is required, and must appear before [hardcaml]. This syntax generates a
    call to [Interface.Make], which therefore does not need to be explicitly called. *)

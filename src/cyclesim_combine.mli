(** Combine 2 simulators. The inputs are set on the 1st simulator and copied to the 2nd.
    Outputs are checked and [on_error] is called if a difference is found. By default,
    [on_error] raises.

    The simulators should have the same input and output port sets, unless
    [port_sets_may_differ] is [true], in which case only ports which exist on both
    simulators are checked. *)

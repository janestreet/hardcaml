(** A [Signal_graph.t] is a created from a list of signals, and defined by tracing back
    to inputs (unassigned wires or constants).  Functions are provided for traversing
    the graph.

    When traversing using [depth_first_seach] we can specify [upto] which means the search
    will stop when it reaches any signal in the given list (which is also /not/ included
    as part of the search).

(** Traverse the graph and find all inputs.  Badly formed inputs (no name, or multiple
    names) return an error. *)

(** Visit all signals in the graph, starting at the outputs, in a depth-first manner.
    Each signal is visited only once.  [f_before] is called before recursing on each
    signal's fan-in.  Similiarly, [f_after] is called after recursing on the fan-in.

    If [deps] is provided it will be used to compute signal dependencies rather
    than the default definition. This is useful for terminating traversals
    based on some condition on signals, e.g., if it's a register or a memory. *)

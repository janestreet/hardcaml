module type Signal = sig
  (** Signal type for constructing logic designs. *)

  type t = Signal__type.t

  module Type = Signal__type

  (** {1 Naming}

      One or more string names applied to a signal. These will be used during RTL code
      generation and simulation to aid design inspection. *)

  include Names with type t := t

  (** {1 Attributes}

      Attributes are attached to signals and written during RTL generation. They can be
      used to control downstream synthesis and place and route tools. They do not
      otherwise affect the Hardcaml circuit. *)

  include Attributes with type t := t

  (** {1 Comments}

      A comment can be associated with a signal, and this is sometimes useful to pass
      information to downstream tooling (specifically Verilator). *)

  include Comments with type t := t

  (** {1 Circuit Input and Output Ports}

      Specification of the module level input and output ports. Ports are represented in
      Hardcaml as wires with a single name. Note that Hardcaml will generally rewrite and
      legalize names depending on context but will not do so for ports. *)

  include Ports with type t := t

  (** {1 Wires}

      Wires are used in Hardcaml to conenct two signals together. They are first created
      then assigned to (internally they have a mutable reference to their driver). Wires
      are how we can create cycles which we require in order to build logic like, for
      example, a counter.

      It is entirely possible to create combinational loops using wires.  Often this is
      not the intent and Hardcaml has functions to detect this - for example, Cyclesim
      will fail if there is such a loop.
  *)

  include Wires with type t := t

  (** {1 Combinational Logic}

      The main combinational logic API for creating things like adders, multiplexers etc.
      This API is the same as provided by [Bits.t].

      By default Hardcaml performs constant propogation over signals - operations with
      purely constant values (and some other simple cases such as [a &: vdd]) will be
      simplified. You can avoid this by using the operations from the [Unoptimized]
      module. *)

  include Logic with type t := t

  (** {1 Registers}

      Registers are configured using a [Reg_spec.t]. This encodes the clock, synchronous
      clear, and asychronous reset used. *)

  include Regs with type t := t

  (** {1 Memories}

      [multiport_memory] provides the low-level primitive from which Hardcaml memories
      are created. It provides a memory with an arbitrary number of read and write ports
      that is asychronously read.

      By default synthesizers will infer either LUT ram or register banks from this
      primitive.

      Limiting the number of read/write ports and placing a register on the read address
      or read output port will allow synthesizers to infer single or simple dual port RAM
      from RTL. [ram_rbw] and [ram_wbr] are examples of this. *)

  include Memories with type t := t

  (** Pretty printer. *)
  val pp : Formatter.t -> t -> unit

  val uid : t -> Type.Uid.t

  (** Returns the list of names assigned to the signal. *)
  val names : t -> string list
